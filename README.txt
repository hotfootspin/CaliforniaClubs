This is a new Maps project. I started it for a class in iOS programming. It is a listing
of square dance clubs in California and they are all geolocated.

This is still configured for iOS 5 and 6. If you wish to compile it for iOS 7, you may need
to turn on Auto Layout and some other features that are not supported in iOS 5.

Thanks,
Mark
